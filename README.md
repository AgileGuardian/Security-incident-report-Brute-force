# Security-incident-report-Brute-force

## Objective
The primary objective of this investigation was to determine the cause of the suspicious behavior reported by customers and to understand how the website and its users were compromised. Specifically, the cybersecurity team aimed to:

1. Identify the source of the malicious prompt that led users to download a harmful file.
2. Understand how the attacker gained access to the website’s administrative account and manipulated the website.
3. Analyze the impact of the malicious file on users’ computers and the website’s operations.
4. Mitigate the threat by identifying vulnerabilities and ensuring that the website and its users are protected from further attacks.

### Skills Learned
During this investigation, the cybersecurity professional developed and applied several key skills:

1. **Threat Identification and Analysis:** Recognizing signs of compromise and suspicious behavior based on customer reports and initial observations.
2. **Sandbox Environment Usage:** Safely opening potentially malicious websites and files in an isolated environment to prevent harm to the company’s network.
3. **Network Traffic Analysis:** Using tools like tcpdump to capture and analyze network traffic, identifying unexpected redirects and malicious activities.
4. **Log Analysis and Pattern Recognition:** Reviewing tcpdump logs to identify sudden changes in network behavior and unauthorized redirects.
5. **Malware Analysis:** Understanding how to dissect and analyze the source code of websites and downloaded files to identify malicious modifications and payloads.
6. **Brute Force Attack Identification:** Recognizing signs of brute force attacks on administrator accounts and understanding how to respond to them.
7. **Incident Response and Mitigation:** Coordinating actions to address the security breach, prevent further damage, and protect users and assets.
### Tools Used
[Bullet Points - Remove this afterwards]

The tools used by the cybersecurity professional during this investigation include:

- **Sandbox Environment:** An isolated, controlled environment where potentially malicious websites and files can be safely examined without risking the company's network security.
- **tcpdump:** A powerful network packet analyzer used to capture and inspect network traffic to identify suspicious activities and potential security threats.
- **Source Code Analysis Tools:** Software or manual techniques for examining the website's source code and the downloaded file to detect any unauthorized changes or embedded malicious code.
- **Access Logs and Security Logs:** Logs from the web server and other systems to track user activities, identify unauthorized access, and understand how the breach occurred.
